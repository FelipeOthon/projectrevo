Humans are overlooking benefits that striders gave to the civilization! Think about it! Strategies at the siege or large-scaled pledge war have changed because of striders, haven't they? The trade has been also stimulated since it became easier to deliver cargos between towns.

Ah, ah~! Should I write a book or something? I'll title it, "Swift Horse and History of the Continent", huh?

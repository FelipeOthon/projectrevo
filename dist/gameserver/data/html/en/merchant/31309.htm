Pet Manager Woods:

Kaiser!  Come here... So... good boy!

Oh, hello?  Yes, that's right...  Isn't it so cute?  It is the pure-bred black-striped Alpen Kuger.  It is originally a violent beast, but you can raise it to become gentle like this if you trained it since it was a baby.  You just need to remember feeding it on time.

Pet Manager Waters:

It's there. It's there... We've got wolf food that wolves absolutely love. If you give this to your wolf, it will turn even a turek warhound to tatters! And we've got steel teeth made by Dwarven hooligans that contributed their own blood. And hatchling products can also be had! Take a look around! Good owners shop at the Pet Kennel of Dion Castle Town!

Gatekeeper Flauen:

Are you leaving so soon? May the blessings of starlight always guide your path...

I hope you enjoyed your stay in Heine! Innadril is by far the most beautiful city in all of Aden. If you haven't witnessed the return of the commercial boats in the twilight or heard the song of the reeds in the wind you should prolong your visit. What do you think?

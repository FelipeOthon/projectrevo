Gatekeeper Esmeralda:

Many feared monsters lurk around Hunters Village. Teleporting is a great choice for travelers who are tired or in a hurry.

Are you homesick? In a hurry to help a friend in need? Or did you suddenly feel like going to the beach? We can send you anywhere on this vast continent in an instant.

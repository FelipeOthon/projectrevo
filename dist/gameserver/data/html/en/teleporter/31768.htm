Event Gatekeeper:

Have you heard?  As of Chronicle 5, a brand new, affordable teleportation option is made available for the exclusive use of the Noblesse!

In celebration of the dawn of a new era, we're offering everyone a chance to utilize this teleportation option normally reserved for the Noblesse.

You are invited to *teleport to nearby hunting grounds for the same price charged to a Noblesse*.

You should try it out!

Fishing Guild Member Gaiba:

Well, since you're here, you must've heard that Rainbow Spring is one of the best places in the world to fish!

This area would be a good place for you to start! The fish are very plump here! I've also heard that *many people have caught Clan Hall War Decrees*! If you want to buy or sell anything, just let me know.

Fishermen's Guild Master Ropfi:

Do you know how to fish?  If you want to learn, I can teach you.  There's nothing as fun and relaxing as fishing.  Highly-stressed people like you need some time alone, or perhaps to be with a few friends in a quiet place like this.

Oh, by the way, if you catch more fish than you can handle, bring them to me!

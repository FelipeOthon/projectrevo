Blacksmith of Mammon:

Ah, yes, the seal of gnosis! May you receive the blessings of Mammon! You have come a long way to find me. I can provide you with the highest-quality weapons and armory.

Blacksmiths the world over try to mimic my refined techniques, but their work pales in comparison to mine.

I must ask you but one thing. As a dwarf of Mammon, I cannot accept money from the outside world. I can only accept payment in Ancient Adena.

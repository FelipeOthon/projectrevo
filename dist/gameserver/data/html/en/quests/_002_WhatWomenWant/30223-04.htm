Arujien:

Thank you. I will not forget your kindness.

I don't want to be rude and commit such blunders as asking her directly. That is not an appropriate course of action towards a lady. However, she has a younger sister. I'm speaking of *Gatekeeper Mirabel*. Perhaps she will know what Greenis' mind is. Please show this letter to Mirabel without letting Greenis know, and tell Mirabel how desperate my heart is. And ask her if Greenis would ever accept my affections. I am entrusting you with this letter, so please discover the true heart of the woman I love.

Gatekeeper Mirabel may be young, but she is Greenis' sister and also a woman. I think she will know Greenis' heart well. Show her my letter, and please tell me her answer.

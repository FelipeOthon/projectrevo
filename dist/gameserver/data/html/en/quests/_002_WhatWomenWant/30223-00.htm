Arujien:

 ... You, have you ever passionately loved someone? Have you ever experienced a passion and affection towards a single person, emotions that exist every waking moment of your day?

As I expected ... you don't understand. I can tell by your eyes ... Your race does not seem to know much of complicated emotions such as love or romance. What a shame ...

(Only Elf and Human characters may undertake this quest.)
